# Poker EV Visualizer

Poker EV visualizer allows the user to easily find the expected value a specific hand has in a specific position at a full 9-handed poker table. The visualizer is built in D3.js and pulls data from an analysis of over 10,000 hands played in Limit Hold 'em poker. The aim of this project is to help players find the overall average amount of big blinds a specific hand will return in the long run depending on where the hand is played from - this is especially important to beginners learning the fundamentals of position and its effect on a hand's playability.
